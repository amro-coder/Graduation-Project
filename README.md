The above link is a Google Collab link for my University of Khartoum graduation project for the year 2023.

Project Description:
This project investigates model extraction attacks, where an adversary can train a
substitute model by collecting data through query access to a victim model and
steal its functionality. We use DistilBERT as the victim model due to its compact
size and faster processing speed compared to BERT. The results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the model extraction attack and show that there is a relation
between its success and the similarity between the training data of the victim
model and the attackerâ€™s queries. The study provides important insights into the
security of DistilBERT models and informs the development of more robust defence
mechanisms against such attacks.

Note:
The link above is part of the project where the extracted model is DistilBERT.
I have tried other models as extracted models, but they all use a similar code.

It is an open review link for the paper made about this project.
PS: the paper was accepted to be published in the ICLR 2023 conference.
